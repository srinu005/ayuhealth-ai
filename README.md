🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (version 18 or higher)
npm or bun
A Google Gemini API Key (obtainable via Google AI Studio)
Installation
Clone or navigate to the repository:
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ayuhealth-ai.git
cd ayuhealth-ai
Install project dependencies:
code
Bash
npm install
Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory (based on .env.example):
code
Bash
cp .env.example .env
Add your Gemini API key to .env:
code
Env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
Start the development server:
code
Bash
npm run dev
Open the application:
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
📋 Available Scripts
npm run dev: Launches the Vite development server on port 3000.
npm run build: Compiles TypeScript and creates an optimized production bundle in /dist.
npm run preview: Previews the production build locally.
npm run lint: Performs type checking via tsc --noEmit.
npm run clean: Cleans up the build output folder.
💡 Regional Voice Output Tips
If you are using Windows and experience silent voice output for languages like Telugu or Kannada:
Automatic Universal Cloud Voice:
The application automatically detects missing local voices and requests high-quality spoken audio from Gemini Cloud TTS. You will hear audio output even if your Windows system does not have the language pack installed!
For Zero-Latency Offline Voices on Windows:
Open Windows Settings > Time & Language > Language & Region.
Click Add a language, search for your language (e.g., Telugu, Tamil, Marathi), and install the language & speech pack.
Alternatively, open the web application in Microsoft Edge, which includes cloud-connected natural neural voices for most Indian languages out of the box.
On Android & Chrome:
Android has built-in Google Speech Services with full support for Indian regional languages. Ensure the Google TTS voice data is updated under Settings > Accessibility > Text-to-Speech Output.
